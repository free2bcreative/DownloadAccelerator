# Download Accelerator

This project basically downloads a file from a given URL with a given amount of threads.  It then reports how fast it downloaded the file.  This is very useful to know how many threads I should use.

## downloadAccelerator.py

The program that I wrote to download the file and time how long it takes with a certain amount of threads.

> python downloadAccelerator.py -n [number of threads] [url]

## experiments.py & plot.py

These are python scripts that our Professor provided to test our programs.  More information can be found at http://cs360.byu.edu/fall-2013/labs/download-accelerator
